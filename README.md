# Physics-PBL-Simulations
How to run the code:

Step 1: Make sure you have python and pip installed. If you install python, pip should install automatically.

Step 2: Open up CMD and type in
  `pip install pygame`
and press enter. let it install.

Step 3: Run the python file for the simulation you want to run by double clicking the .py file.

If double clicking the file doesn't work (ie. it opens up a text editor), right click the file and hover `open with` and hit `python`. Either of the options work. The python with the rocket ship will hide the terminal during the simulation. 

Alternatively, if you don't want to install python, .exe's of each simulation will be in the releases:
